# Zomato-Analytics
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of restaurants from Zomato in Bangalore. The dataset contains detailed information about over 50,000 restaurants, including attributes like ratings, votes, location, cuisine types, availability of online ordering, table booking options, and cost for two people. Through data cleaning, processing, and visualization, we aim to derive meaningful insights about restaurants in Bangalore, focusing on customer preferences, restaurant types, and the impact of various features on ratings and votes.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Zomato's Bangalore restaurant data, uncovering trends and patterns that can provide actionable insights for restaurant owners, customers, and other stakeholders. Specific objectives include:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

- Handle missing values and clean noisy data.
- Transform text-based ratings and costs into numerical formats for analysis.
- Group less frequent categories (e.g., cuisine types, restaurant types) for better visualization and insights.

Feature Analysis:

- Analyze and visualize the distribution of restaurant types, cuisines, and locations.
- Examine factors like table booking, online order availability, and their correlation with restaurant ratings.
- Investigate the cost of dining across different restaurant types and locations.

Rating and Votes Analysis:

- Explore the relationship between restaurant features (e.g., location, type, and online order availability) and customer ratings.
- Identify which locations and cuisines receive the highest number of votes, highlighting popular dining trends in Bangalore.

Visual Insights:

- Use bar plots, box plots, and violin plots to visualize trends and outliers, aiding the interpretation of the data.
- Identify how different restaurant attributes influence customer behavior and preferences through graphical analysis.
